## Introduction 
Val Slab shop is a website that I plan to develop over several years. As I hope to use it to try to solve complicated web development and business problems such as how to most effectively manage orders/contact so that this website can be used effectively to make a profit for a small compnay in Oregon.
List of Specifications:
<ol>
  <li> Display Slab Inventory </li>
  <li> Display Individual Slab Detail[In Progress]</li>
  <li> Display Contact Page </li>
  <li> Display Landing Page </li>
  <li> Allow an admin user to add slabs to website dynamically[In Progress] </li>
  <li> Notify admin/business owner when a contact request is generated[In Progress] </li>
</ol>
I am still mastering React so the structure of my project will likely change and I might approach this project entirely differently in the next few weeks to months..

  Currently ,this application does not utilize state, however in version two, which will be submitted for the second week it will   implemenet state and allow the admin user to manage slabs, and contact requests.

## Setup/Installation

First, clone from `https://github.com/neumanna94/ValSlabShop-React`

```sh
$ npm install
```
then,
```sh
$ npm start run
```
## Bugs
Currently does not implement State in this version of the ValSlabShop React Project.
Therefore, I do not correctly pass my ContactForm requests and SlabList array to the components in project that will use it in the future.

## Notes
Note #1: Developing in React requires a firm understanding of what props and states are used for. Since they are the heavy duty "data-types" that allow React to know what variables we want the virtual dom to compare and contrast. I also have had a hard time understanding the intricacies of React and how to utilize its structure to optimize projects.
